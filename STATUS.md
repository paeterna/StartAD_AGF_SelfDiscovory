## ⏳ Pending Steps

### 1. Database Setup 🎯 CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST
**Priority: HIGH**

You need to run the database migrations to create the required tables.

**Action Required:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/00001_init_schema.sql`
4. Run the script
5. Verify tables are created

**Why It Matters:**
Without this, authentication will fail because there's no place to store user profiles!

**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

---

### 2. Enable Supabase Authentication
**Priority: HIGH**

**Action Required:**
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
2. Verify Email provider is enabled
3. Set Site URL to `http://localhost:3000` (dev) or your production URL
4. Configure redirect URLs

**Estimated Time:** 2 minutes

---

### 3. Configure Google OAuth (Optional but Recommended)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Google Sign-In is already coded! Just needs OAuth configuration.

**Action Required:**
1. Create OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
2. Add redirect URI: `https://twolnvofpdhfakafdsla.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
3. Enable Google provider in Supabase Dashboard
4. Add Client ID and Secret

**Documentation:** See `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md`

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

**Reward:** Working Google Sign-In! 🎉

---

### 4. Replace Mock Repositories
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Currently using mock data. Need to switch to Supabase.

**Repositories to Update:**
- [ ] Auth Repository (highest priority)
- [ ] Progress Repository
- [ ] Career Repository  
- [ ] Activities Repository
- [ ] Assessment Repository
- [ ] Roadmap Repository

**Approach:**
Start with Auth Repository, test it, then move to others one by one.

**Documentation:** See `PHASE2_INTEGRATION.md` Step 4

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours (spread over time)

---

### 5. Testing
**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] User signup flow
- [ ] User login flow
- [ ] Google Sign-In flow
- [ ] Profile creation
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Career matching

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes per repository

---

### 6. Data Migration (Optional)
**Priority: LOW**

If you have existing mock data to preserve, migrate it to Supabase.

**Estimated Time:** Variable

---

### 7. Security & Monitoring
**Priority: MEDIUM** (after repositories work)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- [ ] Set up monitoring in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Configure email templates
- [ ] Test security policies

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

---
