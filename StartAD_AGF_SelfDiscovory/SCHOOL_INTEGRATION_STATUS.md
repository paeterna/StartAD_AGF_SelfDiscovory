## 📋 Manual Setup Steps (After Migration)

### Step 1: Run Migrations

```bash
# Apply migrations to Supabase
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Create School Admin Users

Via Supabase Dashboard or API:

```sql
-- 1. Create auth user via Dashboard (Auth > Users > Add user)
-- Email: admin@adis.ae
-- Password: (set secure password)
-- Get the user_id from the created user

-- 2. Set role metadata
update auth.users
set raw_user_meta_data = jsonb_set(
  coalesce(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb),
  '{role}',
  '"school_admin"'
)
where email = 'admin@adis.ae';

-- 3. Create school admin mapping
insert into public.school_admins (user_id, school_id)
values (
  '<user_id_from_step_1>',
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001' -- ADIS school id
);
```

Repeat for other schools (DAA, SIS).

### Step 3: Assign Students to Schools

```sql
-- Assign existing students to schools for testing
update public.profiles
set school_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001'
where id in (
  select id from public.profiles
  where school_id is null
  order by random()
  limit 10
);
```

### Step 4: Test Access

1. Login as school admin at `/auth/school`
2. Verify redirect to `/school/dashboard`
3. Check KPIs load correctly
4. Verify top students appear
5. Test career distribution chart
6. Attempt to login with regular student account → should show error

## 🔐 Security Verification

### RLS Policy Tests

Test these scenarios to ensure multi-tenant isolation:

1. **School Admin A cannot access School B's data:**
```sql
-- Login as admin@adis.ae (School A)
-- Try to query School B's students
select * from public.get_school_students(
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002'::uuid, -- School B ID
  null, 50, 0
);
-- Should return empty or error
```

2. **Students cannot access school dashboard functions:**
```sql
-- Login as regular student
select * from public.get_school_kpis(
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001'::uuid
);
-- Should fail with permission error
```

3. **School admins can only read, not write:**
```sql
-- Login as school admin
update public.profiles
set display_name = 'Hacked'
where school_id = '<their_school_id>';
-- Should fail due to RLS
```

## 📊 Data Flow

```
School Admin Login
    ↓
Check role == "school_admin"
    ↓
Fetch school from school_admins mapping
    ↓
Load Dashboard with RLS-filtered data:
    - KPIs (get_school_kpis RPC)
    - Top Students (get_school_top_students RPC)
    - Career Distribution (get_school_career_distribution RPC)
    - Feature Averages (v_school_feature_means view)
    ↓
Navigate to Student Detail
    ↓
Fetch student data (RLS ensures same school)
    - user_feature_scores
    - assessments
    - user_career_matches
```
