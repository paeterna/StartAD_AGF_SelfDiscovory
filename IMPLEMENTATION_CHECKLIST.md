## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Logo File**: Ensure `assets/images/logo_selfmap.png` exists and is properly exported
2. **Font Loading**: Google Fonts (Poppins) requires internet connection
3. **Theme Switching**: Works automatically based on system preferences
4. **Color Opacity**: Always use `.withValues(alpha: X)` for Flutter 3.8+
5. **Hot Reload**: Theme changes require hot restart (not just hot reload)

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing
```bash
# Check if asset is registered
grep -r "logo_selfmap.png" pubspec.yaml

# Verify file exists
ls -la assets/images/logo_selfmap.png

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Colors Not Updating
```bash
# Hot restart (not hot reload)
# Press 'R' in terminal (capital R)

# Or stop and restart
flutter run
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Check for null safety issues
flutter analyze

# Check for compile errors
flutter build web --verbose
