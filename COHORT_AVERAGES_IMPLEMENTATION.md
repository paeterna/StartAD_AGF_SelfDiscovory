# Real Cohort Averages Implementation

## Problem
The radar chart was showing static average scores (always 50.0) instead of actual averages calculated from all users in the database.

## Solution
Created a system that automatically calculates and updates cohort averages based on real user data.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration: `00012_real_cohort_averages.sql`

Created a new migration that implements:

#### A. `update_cohort_stats()` Function
Calculates real statistics from all users:
- **Mean**: Average score across all users for each feature
- **Standard Deviation**: Population standard deviation
- **Min/Max**: Minimum and maximum scores observed
- **N Samples**: Number of users contributing to each feature

```sql
SELECT update_cohort_stats();
```

#### B. Automatic Trigger
Automatically updates cohort statistics when user scores change:
- Triggers on INSERT or UPDATE of `user_feature_scores`
- Only updates if score changes by more than 1 point (prevents excessive updates)
- Updates only the specific feature that changed (efficient)

#### C. Performance Optimization
Added index for faster cohort calculations:
```sql
idx_user_feature_scores_feature_score on (feature_key, score_mean)
```

---

## How It Works

### Before (Static)
```
feature_cohort_stats.mean = 50.0 (hardcoded for all features)
```

### After (Dynamic)
```sql
-- Real calculation from all users
SELECT avg(score_mean)
FROM user_feature_scores
WHERE feature_key = 'trait_creativity'
  AND n >= 1;
```

### Data Flow
```
1. User completes assessment
   â†“
2. Scores saved to user_feature_scores
   â†“
3. Trigger fires: trigger_update_cohort_stats()
   â†“
4. feature_cohort_stats updated with new average
   â†“
5. Radar chart shows updated cohort average
```

---

## Applying the Migration

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (SQL Editor)
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/00012_real_cohort_averages.sql`
4. Click **Run**
5. Verify success (should see "Success" message)

### Option 2: Supabase CLI (if available)
```bash
# From project root
supabase db push

# Or migrate specific file
supabase db execute --file supabase/migrations/00012_real_cohort_averages.sql
```

### Option 3: Manual SQL Execution
Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:
```bash
psql <your-connection-string> < supabase/migrations/00012_real_cohort_averages.sql
```

---

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Check Current Cohort Stats (Before)
```sql
SELECT feature_key, mean, n_samples, last_updated
FROM feature_cohort_stats
ORDER BY feature_key;
```

You should see all means = 50.0 and n_samples = 0.

### 2. Apply Migration
Run the migration using one of the methods above.

### 3. Check Cohort Stats (After)
```sql
SELECT feature_key, mean, std_dev, n_samples, last_updated
FROM feature_cohort_stats
ORDER BY feature_key;
```

Now you should see:
- Real averages based on actual user data
- Non-zero n_samples (if users exist)
- Recent last_updated timestamps

### 4. Test Automatic Updates
Insert a test score:
```sql
-- Insert a new score for a test user
INSERT INTO user_feature_scores (user_id, feature_key, score_mean, n)
VALUES (
  auth.uid(), -- current user
  'trait_creativity',
  85.0,
  5
)
ON CONFLICT (user_id, feature_key) DO UPDATE
SET score_mean = 85.0, n = 5;

-- Check if cohort stats updated automatically
SELECT feature_key, mean, n_samples, last_updated
FROM feature_cohort_stats
WHERE feature_key = 'trait_creativity';
```

The trigger should have automatically updated the cohort average!

### 5. Test Radar Chart in App
1. Run the Flutter app
2. Navigate to any page with a radar chart
3. The "Average" line should now reflect real user averages (not always 50.0)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Trigger Optimization
The trigger only updates when:
- New feature score is inserted (INSERT)
- Existing score changes by more than 1 point (UPDATE)

This prevents excessive database updates for minor score adjustments.

### Query Optimization
The added index speeds up cohort calculations:
```sql
idx_user_feature_scores_feature_score on (feature_key, score_mean)
```

### Scalability
For very large user bases (100k+ users), consider:
1. **Debounced updates**: Update cohort stats every N minutes instead of on every change
2. **Materialized views**: Create a materialized view that refreshes periodically
3. **Background job**: Calculate cohort stats via a scheduled Edge Function

---

## Manual Recalculation

If you ever need to manually recalculate all cohort statistics:

```sql
-- Recalculate all cohort averages
SELECT update_cohort_stats();
```

This is useful if:
- You bulk import user data
- You suspect stats are out of sync
- You want to force a fresh calculation

---

## Verification Queries

### Check Feature Coverage
```sql
-- How many users have scores for each feature?
SELECT
  f.key as feature_key,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ufs.user_id) as user_count,
  ROUND(AVG(ufs.score_mean)::numeric, 1) as avg_score,
  ROUND(fcs.mean::numeric, 1) as cohort_mean
FROM features f
LEFT JOIN user_feature_scores ufs ON ufs.feature_key = f.key AND ufs.n >= 1
LEFT JOIN feature_cohort_stats fcs ON fcs.feature_key = f.key
GROUP BY f.key, fcs.mean
ORDER BY user_count DESC;
```

### Check Cohort Stats Update History
```sql
-- See when cohort stats were last updated
SELECT
  feature_key,
  mean,
  n_samples,
  last_updated,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_updated))/60 as minutes_ago
FROM feature_cohort_stats
ORDER BY last_updated DESC;
```

### Validate Calculations
```sql
-- Verify cohort stats match manual calculations
SELECT
  fcs.feature_key,
  fcs.mean as stored_mean,
  (
    SELECT AVG(score_mean)
    FROM user_feature_scores
    WHERE feature_key = fcs.feature_key AND n >= 1
  ) as calculated_mean,
  fcs.n_samples as stored_count,
  (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
    FROM user_feature_scores
    WHERE feature_key = fcs.feature_key AND n >= 1
  ) as calculated_count
FROM feature_cohort_stats fcs
ORDER BY fcs.feature_key;
```

If `stored_mean` â‰  `calculated_mean`, run `SELECT update_cohort_stats();`

---

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to revert to static averages:

```sql
-- Disable the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trg_update_cohort_stats ON user_feature_scores;

-- Reset to static values
UPDATE feature_cohort_stats
SET mean = 50.0, std_dev = 10.0, n_samples = 0;
```

---

## No Code Changes Required!

The best part: **No Flutter code changes needed**!

The existing code in [`radar_traits_card.dart`](lib/presentation/widgets/radar_traits_card.dart) already fetches data from `v_user_radar` view, which in turn reads from `feature_cohort_stats`.

The view query (from migration 00004):
```sql
SELECT
  ...
  coalesce(fcs.mean, 50.0) as cohort_mean_0_100
FROM features f
LEFT JOIN feature_cohort_stats fcs ON fcs.feature_key = f.key
```

Once the migration runs, the cohort means will automatically be real averages! âœ¨

---

## Expected Results

### Before Migration
- All radar charts show average at 50.0 for every feature
- Average line forms a perfect circle/polygon at the center

### After Migration
- Radar charts show real averages based on actual user data
- Average line varies by feature (e.g., creativity might be 62.5, leadership 45.3)
- More meaningful comparison between user scores and population

---

## Monitoring

### Daily Health Check
```sql
-- Check that cohort stats are updating
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as features_with_data,
  MIN(last_updated) as oldest_update,
  MAX(last_updated) as newest_update
FROM feature_cohort_stats
WHERE n_samples > 0;
```

### Alert if stats are stale (>7 days)
```sql
SELECT feature_key, last_updated
FROM feature_cohort_stats
WHERE last_updated < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND n_samples > 0;
```

---

## Summary

### What Changed
1. âœ… Created `update_cohort_stats()` function to calculate real averages
2. âœ… Added automatic trigger to update on user score changes
3. âœ… Added performance index for faster calculations
4. âœ… Initial recalculation from existing data

### What Stayed the Same
- Flutter code (no changes needed!)
- View definition
- RPC function
- User interface

### Result
ðŸŽ‰ Radar charts now display **real cohort averages** instead of static 50.0 values!
